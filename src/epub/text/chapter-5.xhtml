			<p>I woke sharply and suddenly from a dream in that empty room. It was Grizzlebeard that had put his hand upon my shoulder. The late winter dawn was barely glimmering, and there was mist upon the heath outside and rime upon the windows.</p>
			<div class="aside">The Place in the Mind</div>
			<p>I woke and shuddered. For in my dream I had come to a good place, the place inside the mind, which is all made up of remembrance and of peace. Here I had seemed to be in a high glade of beeches, standing<!--Page 298--> on soft, sweet grass on a slope very high above the sea; the air was warm and the sea was answering the sunlight, very far below me. It was such a place as my own Downs have made for me in my mind, but the Downs transfigured, and the place was full of glory and of content, height and great measurement fit for the beatitude of the soul. Nor had I in that dream any memory of loss, but rather a complete end of it, and I was surrounded, though I could not see them, with the return of all those things that had ever been my own. But this was in the dream only; and when I woke it was to the raw world and the sad uncertain beginnings of a little winter day.</p>
			<div class="aside">My Companions Rise</div>
			<p>Grizzlebeard, who had woken me, said gravely:</p>
			<p>“We must be up early. Let us waken the others also, and take the road, for we are near the end of our journey. We have come to the term and boundary of this short passage of ours, and of our brief companionship, for we must reach the County<!--Page 299--> border in these early hours. So awake, and waken the others.”</p>
			<p>Then I woke the other two, who also stirred and looked wearily at the thin, grey light, but rose in their turn, and then I said to Grizzlebeard:</p>
			<p>“Shall we not eat before we start to the place after which we shall not see each other any more?”</p>
			<p>But he said, “No, we have but a little way to go, and when we have gone that little way together, we will break a crust between us, and pledge each other if you will, and then we shall never see each other any more.”</p>
			<p>The others also said that this was the way in which the matter should be accomplished.</p>
			<p>Yielding to them, therefore (for I perceived that they were greater than I), we went out into the morning mist and walked through it sturdily enough, but silent, the sounds of our footsteps coming close into our ears, blanketed and curtained by the fog. For a mile and second mile and a third no one of us spoke a word to another. But as I<!--Page 300--> walked along I looked furtively first to one side and then to the other, judging my companions, whom chance had given me for these few hours; and it seemed to me (whether from the mist or what not) that they were taller than men; and their eyes avoided my eyes.</p>
			<div class="aside">We Break Bread</div>
			<p>When we had come to Treyford, Grizzlebeard, who was by dumb assent at this moment our leader, or at any rate certainly mine, took that lane northward which turns through Redlands and up to the hill of Elstead and its inn. Then for the first time he spoke and said:</p>
			<p>“Here we will break a loaf, and pledge each other for the last time.”</p>
			<p>Which we did, all sitting quite silent, and then again we took the road, and went forward as we had gone forward before, until we came to Harting. And when we came to Harting, just in the village street of it, Grizzlebeard, going forward a little more quickly, drew with him his two companions, and they stood before me, barring the road as it were, and looking at me kindly, but halting my advance.</p>
			<!--Page 301-->
			<div class="aside">They Will Not Stay</div>
			<p>I said to them, a little afraid, “Do you make for our parting now? We are not yet come to the county border!”</p>
			<p>But Grizzlebeard said (the others keeping silent):⁠—</p>
			<p>“Yes. As we met upon this side of the county border, so shall we part before we cross it. Nor shall you cross it with us. But these my companions and I, when we have crossed it must go each to our own place: but you are perhaps more fortunate, for you are not far from your home.”</p>
			<p>When he had said this, I was confused to wonder from his voice and from the larger aspect of himself and his companions, whether indeed they were men.</p>
			<p>“… And is there,” I said, “in all the county another such company of four; shall I find even one companion like any of you? Now who is there to-day that can pour out songs as you can at every hour and make up the tunes as well? And even if they could so sing, would any such man or men be of one faith with me?</p>
			<p>“Come back with me,” I said, “along the<!--Page 302--> crest of the Downs; we will overlook together the groves at Lavington and the steep at Bury Combe, and then we will turn south and reach a house I know of upon the shingle, upon the tide, near where the Roman palaces are drowned beneath the Owers; and to-night once more, and if you will for the last time, by another fire we will sing yet louder songs, and mix them with the noise of the sea.”</p>
			<div class="aside">Nor Linger with Me</div>
			<p>But Grizzlebeard would not even linger. He looked at me with a dreadful solemnity and said:</p>
			<p>“No; we are all three called to other things. But do you go back to your home, for the journey is done.”</p>
			<p>Then he added (but in another voice); “There is nothing at all that remains: nor any house; nor any castle, however strong; nor any love, however tender and sound; nor any comradeship among men, however hardy. Nothing remains but the things of which I will not speak, because we have spoken enough of them already during these four days. But I who am old will give you advice, which is this⁠—to consider chiefly from<!--Page 303--> now onward those permanent things which are, as it were, the shores of this age and the harbours of our glittering and pleasant but dangerous and wholly changeful sea.”</p>
			<div class="aside">For All Things End</div>
			<p>When he had said this (by which he meant Death), the other two, looking sadly at me, stood silent also for about the time in which a man can say good-bye with reverence. Then they all three turned about and went rapidly and with a purpose up the village street.</p>
			<p>I watched them, straining my sad eyes, but in a moment the mist received them and they had disappeared.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>I went up in gloom, by the nearest spur, on to the grass and into the loneliness of the high Downs that are my brothers and my repose; and, once upon their crest, setting my face eastward I walked on in a fever for many hours back towards the places from which we had come; and below me as I went was that good landscape in which I had passed such rare and memorable hours.</p>
			<div class="aside">I Follow the Crest of the Downs Alone</div>
			<p>I still went on, through little spinnies here and there, and across the great wave tops and<!--Page 304--> rolls of the hills, and as the day proceeded and the light declined about me I still went on, now dipping into the gaps where tracks and roads ran over the chain, now passing for a little space into tall and silent woods wherever these might stand. And all the while I came nearer and nearer to an appointed spot of which a memory had been fixed for years in my mind. But as I strode, with such a goal in view, an increasing loneliness oppressed me, and the air of loss and the echo of those profound thoughts which had filled the last words we four had exchanged together.</p>
			<p>It was in the grove above Lavington, near the mounds where they say old kings are buried, that I, still following the crest of my hills, felt the full culmination of all the twenty tides of mutability which had thus run together to make a skerry in my soul. I saw and apprehended, as a man sees or touches a physical thing, that nothing of our sort remains, and that even before my county should cease to be itself I should have left it. I recognised that I was (and I confessed) in that attitude of the mind wherein men<!--Page 305--> admit mortality; something had already passed from me⁠—I mean that fresh and vigorous morning of the eyes wherein the beauty of this land had been reflected as in a tiny mirror of burnished silver. Youth was gone out apart; it was loved and regretted, and therefore no longer possessed.</p>
			<p>Then, as I walked through this wood more slowly, pushing before me great billows of dead leaves, as the bows of a ship push the dark water before them, this side and that, when the wind blows full on the middle of the sail and the water answers loudly as the ship sails on, so I went till suddenly I remembered with the pang that catches men at the clang of bells what this time was in November; it was the Day of the Dead. All that day I had so moved and thought alone and fasting, and now the light was falling. I had consumed the day in that deep wandering on the heights alone, and now it was evening. Just at that moment of memory I looked up and saw that I was there. I had come upon that lawn which I had fixed for all these hours to be my goal.</p>
			<div class="aside">The Evening Gathers Over All the Weald</div>
			<p>It is the great platform just over Barl’ton<!--Page 306--> whence all the world lies out before one. Eastward into the night for fifty miles stretched on the wall of the Downs, and it stretched westward towards the coloured sky where a full but transfigured daylight still remained. Southward was the belt of the sea, very broad, as it is from these bare heights, and absolutely still; nor did any animal move in the brushwood near me to insult the majesty of that silence. Northward before me and far below swept the Weald.</p>
			<p>The haze had gone; the sky was faint and wintry, but pure throughout its circle, and above the Channel hung largely the round of the moon, still pale, because the dark had not yet come.</p>
			<p>But though she had been worshipped so often upon such evenings and from such a place, a greater thing now moved and took me from her, and turning round I looked north from the ridge of the steep escarpment over the plain to the rivers and the roofs of the Weald. I would have blessed them had I known some form of word or spell which might convey an active benediction, but as I<!--Page 307--> knew none such, I repeated instead the list of their names to serve in place of a prayer.</p>
			<p>The river Arun, a valley of sacred water; and Amberley Wild brook, which is lonely with reeds at evening; and Burton Great House, where I had spent nights in November; and Lavington also and Hidden Byworth; and Fittleworth next on, and Egdean Side, all heath and air; and the lake and the pine trees at the mill; and Petworth, little town.</p>
			<p>All the land which is knit in with our flesh, and yet in which a man cannot find an acre nor a wall of his own.</p>
			<p>I knew as this affection urged me that verse alone would satisfy something at least of that irremediable desire. I lay down therefore at full length upon the short grass which the sheep also love, and taking out a little stump of pencil that I had, and tearing off the back of a letter, I held my words prepared.</p>
			<div class="aside">A Piece of Verse Is Written and I Come to My Home</div>
			<p>My metre, which at first eluded me (though it had been with me in a way for many hours) was given me by these chance lines that came:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“… and therefore even youth that dies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May leave of right its legacies.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<!--Page 308-->
			<p>I put my pencil upon the paper, doubtfully and drew little lines, considering my theme. But I would not long hesitate in this manner, for I knew that all creation must be chaos first, and then gestures in the void before it can cast out the completed thing. So I put down in fragments this line and that; and thinking first of how many children below me upon that large and fruitful floor were but entering what I must perforce abandon, I wrote down:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“… and of mine opulence I leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every Sussex girl and boy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lot in universal joy.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Having written this down, I knew clearly what was in my mind.</p>
			<p>The way in which our land and we mix up together and are part of the same thing sustained me, and led on the separate parts of my growing poem towards me; introducing them one by one; till at last I wrote down this further line:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“One with our random fields we grow.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>And since I could not for the moment fill in<!--Page 309--> the middle of the verse, I wrote the end, which was already fashioned:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“… because of lineage and because</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soil and memories out of mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Embranch and broaden all mankind.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Ah! but if a man is part of and is rooted in one steadfast piece of earth, which has nourished him and given him his being, and if he can on his side lend it glory and do it service (I thought), it will be a friend to him for ever, and he has outflanked Death in a way.</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“And I shall pass” (thought I), “but this shall stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Almost as long as No-Man’s Land.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“No, certainly,” I answered to myself aloud, “he does not die!” Then from that phrase there ran the fugue, and my last stanzas stood out clear at once, complete and full, and I wrote them down as rapidly as writing can go.</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“He does not die” (I wrote) “that can bequeath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some influence to the land he knows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or dares, persistent, interwreath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love permanent with the wild hedgerows;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He does not die, but still remains</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Substantiate with his darling plains.</span>
				</p>
				<!--Page 310-->
				<p>
					<span>“The spring’s superb adventure calls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His dust athwart the woods to flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His boundary river’s secret falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perpetuate and repeat his name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He rides his loud October sky:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He does not die. He does not die.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The beeches know the accustomed head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which loved them, and a peopled air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath their benediction spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comforts the silence everywhere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For native ghosts return and these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perfect the mystery in the trees.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“So, therefore, though myself be crosst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shuddering of that dreadful day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When friend and fire and home are lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even children drawn away⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The passer-by shall hear me still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A boy that sings on Duncton Hill.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Full of these thoughts and greatly relieved by their metrical expression, I went, through the gathering darkness, southward across the Downs to my home.</p>
			<blockquote>

					<b>Finis</b>
